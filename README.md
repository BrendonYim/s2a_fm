======

Arduino users! Would you like to configure and control your Arduino micro-controller without having
to write a single line of Arduino sketch code and at the same time have access to a graphical user
interface?

Scratch programmers! Would you like to control and communicate with an Arduino board using
Scratch? Imagine, using Scratch to control physical devices such as LEDs, motors, and relays while
monitoring devices, such as temperature sensors, potentiometers, and light sensors. What would you
create?

s2a_fm is a Scratch hardware extension written in Python allowing Scratch and an Arduino
micro-controller to communicate seamlessly.

Make sure you get the latest version of the Scratch Off-Line editor.
